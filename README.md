The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and earliest known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This shift value serves as the key to encrypt and decrypt messages.

Project Overview:

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm to provide a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text messages. Users can input a message along with a shift value to perform encryption or decryption operations. The program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, ensuring that the original message can be accurately recovered after decryption.

Features:

Encryption: Users can input a message and specify a shift value to encrypt the text.
Decryption: Users can input an encrypted message and specify the original shift value to decrypt the text.
Support for Different Shift Values: The program accommodates positive and negative shift values to encrypt and decrypt messages in both forward and backward directions.
Handling of Non-Alphabetic Characters: Non-alphabetic characters such as numbers and special symbols remain unchanged during encryption and decryption, ensuring that the integrity of the message is preserved.
User-Friendly Interface: The program provides clear prompts and instructions to guide users through the encryption and decryption process, making it accessible to individuals with varying levels of technical expertise.
By leveraging the simplicity and effectiveness of the Caesar Cipher, this Python program offers a practical solution for securing text-based communications while also serving as an educational tool for understanding fundamental concepts of cryptography.
